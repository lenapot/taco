Here is an application for ordering tacos.

It uses the following technologies:
- Spring Boot,
- Spring Security,
- Spring Data JPA,
- Thymeleaf,
- Bootstrap.

The application is based on ideas from the book Spring in Action (5th edition).


The app allows you to create your own tacos from different ingredients and place an order.

The administrator can view all orders, change their status, and view reports.
