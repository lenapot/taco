Here is an application for ordering tacos.

It uses the following technologies:
- Spring Boot,
- Spring Security,
- Spring Data JPA,
- Thymeleaf,
- Bootstrap.

The application is based on ideas from the book Spring in Action (5th edition).


The taco application allows you to order tacos, as well as view a list of created tacos and your orders.
