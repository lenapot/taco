### Taco Application ğŸŒ®
Here is an application for ordering tacos.

It uses the following technologies:
- Spring Boot,
- Spring Security,
- Spring Data JPA,
- Liquibase,
- Thymeleaf,
- Bootstrap.

The application is based on ideas from the book Spring in Action (5th edition).

The app allows you to create your own tacos from different ingredients and place an order.

The administrator can view all orders, change their status, and view reports.

## Database

This project uses a PostgreSQL database. The database name can be changed easily in the application.properties.
In this example the database is called 'tacocloud'.
You **have to** create the database before running the project.

## Liquibase

Master changelog file contains references to init.sql and data.sql.

File init.sql contains scripts to:
   - create tables: ingredient, roles, taco_type, taco, taco_type_ingredients, taco_order, users, users_roles, 
   - insert values to ingredient, roles, 
   - create default user admin/1
File data.sql inserts some example rows to database.
